# starfield
Colourful stars generated ahead and swirling around the screen - my first use of polygons in pygame

The stars are generated from a class Star.   The points making up each star use variables so they can be moved and scaled as required.
I use random colours for each star and the colours then vary slowly with each cycle.
The swirl pattern changes direction at a specific interval.

There is only one file 'sandpit.py'
